# 🥾🏞️ The Trail

Every year, Hack Clubbers go on grand adventures. This year, we're embarking on the Pacific Crest Trail equipped with only the trail equipment that we build. This is going to be a community effort and for those that make their equipment, they will be shipped onto the Pacific Crest Trail (through the travel stipends available). 

The Trail is a 7 IRL day hike along the Pacific Crest Trail and a 4 week online hiking equipment building event with 30 Hack Clubbers. We'll be building the equipment together on the Hack Club Slack, specifically in #the-trail channel.
