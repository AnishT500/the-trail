Dear Adults Responsible for Hack Clubbers,

As you may already be aware, your child is embarking on an incredible adventureâ€”a 7-day hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. This journey promises to be a quite the experience for all involved. 

We understand that entrusting your child on such an adventure can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. Rest assured, the safety and well-being of your child are our top priorities throughout this entire trip. We have taken every precaution to ensure a safe and fun experience for everyone.

Hack Club staff will be accompanying the group every step of the way. They have trained in Wilderness First Aid and are equipped to handle any situation that may occur. In the unlikely event of an emergency, our staff are equipped with satellite communication devices to reach out for assistance promptly.

Before leaving, all Clubbers will go thorough orientation sessions to familiarize themselves with the trail, camping procedures, and Leave No Trace principles. We emphasize all of this in the Trail Handbook they will receive which also include our camping itinerary to share with you. 

While the Pacific Crest Trail offers stunning opportunities for exploration, it also serves as a chance to test their inventions on the go-supporting personal growth, perserverance, and the Hacky mindset we so often see in them. We also hope they leave with a deep appreciation for nature's beauty. 

If you have any questions, concerns, or would like to discuss any aspect of The Trail further, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to address any concerns you may have and provide reassurance as your child sets out on this remarkable adventure.

Thank you for trusting us with the privilege of guiding your child along the Pacific Crest Trail. We look forward to sharing stories of unforgettable moments and lifelong friendships when we return them to your care.

Best wishes, 
Sarah and Thomas and everyone at Hack Club HQ
